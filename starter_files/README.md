# Machine Learning Operations using Azure

This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML developer Nanodegree program. In this project, we will use Azure to configure a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploy it, and consume it. ML model using AutoML in Azure. We will also create, publish, and consume a pipeline. This project provides hands on experience on automation. Automation is corepillar of dev ops, applicable to ML operations, i.e., we will automate from creating ML pipeline, publishing a pipeline so that external services can interact with them, and consume pipeline end point.

ML consits of code + data which is different from general software project which consists only code. Building reproducible pipelines, configuring pipelines, configuring continious integration, continious deployment, consuming end point are all part of ML operations. Constant evaluation and monitoring with robust deployment is necessary for secured and reliable model.

Some of the tools we use for MLOps are Azure Ml Studio, Azure Python SDK, Jupyter note book, Swagger, Apache bench mark and terminal window. 

Pipeline automation is corepillar of MLOps. Pipelines help us in automating from creating ML pipelines, publishing pipelines so that we can use the pipelines in CI/CD process.
Published pipelines can be consumed by pipeline endpoint.

Data is constantly changing, business needs changes which requires model to be retrained. This can be achieved effectively by creating Azure pipelines. Azure pipelines can be deployed in CI/CD enviroment which can be trained and new model can be deployed 


## Key Steps
