# Machine Learning Operations using Azure

This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML developer Nanodegree program. In this project, we will use Azure to configure a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploy it, and consume it. ML model using AutoML in Azure. We will also create, publish, and consume a pipeline. This project provides hands on experience on automation. Automation is corepillar of dev ops, applicable to ML operations, i.e., we will automate from creating ML pipeline, publishing a pipeline so that external services can interact with them, and consume pipeline end point.


## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
